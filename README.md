# 🍄 MycoMind – Mushroom Classification App

**MycoMind** is a machine learning-powered web app built with **Streamlit** that predicts whether a mushroom is **edible** or **poisonous** based on its physical characteristics.  
The model is trained on the **UCI Mushroom Dataset** and supports **22 features** for precise classification.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Real-time predictions** using a trained Decision Tree model  
- ✅ **Full dataset support** – all 22 mushroom features are included  
- ✅ **User-friendly interface** built with Streamlit  
- ✅ **Data preprocessing** with Label Encoding and Standard Scaling  
- ✅ **High accuracy** with Decision Tree model

## 📂 Dataset

The app uses the **Mushroom Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom), which contains descriptions of hypothetical samples of mushrooms.  
Each instance is classified as either:

- **`e`** → Edible  
- **`p`** → Poisonous
